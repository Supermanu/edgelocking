# EdgeLocking
EdgeLocking allows to lock your session by mouse hover above top right corner followed by the right edge.

# Install
With kf5 go in the root directory and install the script by
```
plasmapkg2 --type kwinscript -i .
```
Then go to `SystemSettings >> Window Management >> KWinScript` and trigger EdgeLocking.

# Usage

In order to lock your active session, move your mouse to the right top corner of your screen and then on the right edge.
As Kwin edge hover detection is quite fussy, be sure you are as close as it could to the corner/edge.
